# ECE160 - HW#9

Due 03/29/25 at 11:59PM.  
Late submissions are subject to a 20% late penalty.  

## Reading
Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner, chapters 1-4

## Instructions
You may work individually or in a pair for all assignments. If you do so, make sure that each member of the pair submits an answer to at least 1 question.

For each question, you will be submitting the homework via Github pull requests, just like how the industry submits code for review. 

Please follow the instructions carefully. Note: failure to do so will result in a reduction of 20% of this homework grade. If you make a mistake, you can always delete the entire repo and try again (but of course, save your code).  
1. Go to the provided hw link.  
2. Create a team (individual or a pair).  
3. Clone the repository to your unix environment and work on the main branch. If you are working in a pair, each of you will have to make at least 1 commit.
4. Answer each question in their respective folder and name the file q#.py where # is the question number. Do this unless otherwise specified.  
5. Push your main branch to the Github repository.
6. This will automatically create a pull request and perform auto grading.

For all questions, you must do the following:
* Submit runable code
* Edit the README.md with the running command (even if it is just one line)
* Edit the README.md to have the output of the program.
