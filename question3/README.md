## Question 3

Write a Python program that accepts an integer input and prints the following based on the input:

```
Input Integer       Print
90 to 100           You will receive an A.
80 to 89            You will receive a B.
70 to 79            You will receive a C.
60 to 69            You will receive a D.
0 to 59             You will receive an F.
Any other input     Invalid input!
```

Hint: The input function returns a string. You will have to cast the input to an int as the typing in Python is automatic. The following is an example of converting a string to an int:
```
grade = int("75")
```
